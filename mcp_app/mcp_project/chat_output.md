Here are 3 papers on Machine Learning:

1. **[Lecture Notes: Optimization for Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03550v1)**
   - **Authors**: Elad Hazan
   - **Summary**: Lecture notes on optimization for machine learning, derived from a course at Princeton University and tutorials given in MLSS, Buenos Aires, as well as Simons Foundation, Berkeley.
   - **Published Date**: 2019-09-08

2. **[An Optimal Control View of Adversarial Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04422v1)**
   - **Authors**: Xiaojin Zhu
   - **Summary**: The paper describes an optimal control view of adversarial machine learning, where the dynamical system is the machine learner, the input are adversarial actions, and the control costs are defined by the adversary's goals to do harm and be hard to detect. This view encompasses many types of adversarial machine learning, encouraging the utilization of advances in control theory and reinforcement learning.
   - **Published Date**: 2018-11-11

3. **[Minimax deviation strategies for machine learning and recognition with short learning samples](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.04849v1)**
   - **Authors**: Michail Schlesinger, Evgeniy Vodolazskiy
   - **Summary**: The article addresses the problem of small learning samples in machine learning. It reviews the flaws of maximum likelihood learning and minimax learning and introduces the concept of minimax deviation learning, which is free of those flaws.
   - **Published Date**: 2017-07-16
