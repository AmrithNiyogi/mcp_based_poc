    "summary": "We report that the gas components in the N59 bubble suffered from sequential\nmultiple cloud-cloud collision (CCC) processes. The molecular gas in the N59\nbubble can be decomposed into four velocity components, namely Cloud A [95,\n108] km s$^{-1}$, Cloud B [86, 95] km s$^{-1}$, Cloud C [79, 86] km s$^{-1}$\nand Cloud D [65, 79] km s$^{-1}$. Four CCC processes occurred among these four\nvelocity components, i.e., Cloud A vs. Cloud B, Cloud A vs. Cloud C, Cloud C\nvs. Cloud D, and Cloud A vs. Cloud D. Using Spitzer MIR and UKIDSS NIR\nphotometric point source catalogs, we identified 514 YSO candidates clustered\nin 13 YSO groups, and most of them (~60$\\%$) were located at the colliding\ninterfaces, indicating that they were mainly triggered by these four CCC\nprocesses. We also found that these four collisions occurred in a time\nsequential order: the earliest and most violent collision occurred between\nCloud A and Cloud D about 2 Myr ago, then Cloud B collided with Cloud A about 1\nMyr ago, and finally, Cloud C collided with Clouds A and D simultaneously about\n0.4 Myr ago.",

    "summary": "Integrating Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) with cloud computing\ninstances is a rapidly emerging trend on commercial cloud computing platforms\nsuch as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Huawei cloud, and Alibaba cloud. Cloud FPGAs\nallow cloud users to build hardware accelerators to speed up the computation in\nthe cloud. However, since the cloud FPGA technology is still in its infancy,\nthe security implications of this integration of FPGAs in the cloud are not\nclear. In this paper, we survey the emerging field of cloud FPGA security,\nproviding a comprehensive overview of the security issues related to cloud\nFPGAs, and highlighting future challenges in this research area.",

    "summary": "Enterprises are driving towards less cost, more availability, agility,\nmanaged risk - all of which is accelerated towards Cloud Computing. Cloud is\nnot a particular product, but a way of delivering IT services that are\nconsumable on demand, elastic to scale up and down as needed, and follow a\npay-for-usage model. Out of the three common types of cloud computing service\nmodels, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a service model that provides\nservers, computing power, network bandwidth and Storage capacity, as a service\nto their subscribers. Cloud can relate to many things but without the\nfundamental storage pieces, which is provided as a service namely Cloud\nStorage, none of the other applications is possible. This paper introduces\nCloud Storage, which covers the key technologies in cloud computing and Cloud\nStorage, management insights about cloud computing, different types of cloud\nservices, driving forces of cloud computing and cloud storage, advantages and\nchallenges of cloud storage and concludes by pinpointing few challenges to be\naddressed by the cloud storage providers.",

This paper\ndiscussed the interoperability among clouds about message transmission, data\ntransmission and virtual machine transfer. Starting from IEEE Pioneering Cloud\nComputing Initiative, this paper discussed about standardization of the cloud\ncomputing, especially intercloud cloud computing. This paper also discussed the\nstandardization from the market-oriented view.",
