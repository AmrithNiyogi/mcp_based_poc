    "summary": "We investigate conditions under which a co-computably enumerable closed set\nin a computable metric space is computable and prove that in each locally\ncomputable computable metric space each co-computably enumerable compact\nmanifold with computable boundary is computable. In fact, we examine the notion\nof a semi-computable compact set and we prove a more general result: in any\ncomputable metric space each semi-computable compact manifold with computable\nboundary is computable. In particular, each semi-computable compact\n(boundaryless) manifold is computable.",

    "summary": "In computable topology, a represented space is called computably discrete if\nits equality predicate is semidecidable. While any such space is classically\nisomorphic to an initial segment of the natural numbers, the\ncomputable-isomorphism types of computably discrete represented spaces exhibit\na rich structure. We show that the widely studied class of computably\nenumerable equivalence relations (ceers) corresponds precisely to the\ncomputably Quasi-Polish computably discrete spaces. We employ computably\ndiscrete spaces to exhibit several separating examples in computable topology.\nWe construct a computably discrete computably Quasi-Polish space admitting no\ndecidable properties, a computably discrete and computably Hausdorff\nprecomputably Quasi-Polish space admitting no computable injection into the\nnatural numbers, a two-point space which is computably Hausdorff but not\ncomputably discrete, and a two-point space which is computably discrete but not\ncomputably Hausdorff. We further expand an example due to Weihrauch that\nseparates computably regular spaces from computably normal spaces.",
